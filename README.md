# SBISIS-Standardized Ball Information Sure Independence Screening

SBISIS is a generic nonparametric sure
independence screening procedure, on the basis of a recently
developed universal dependence measure: standardized ball information.

Four defining characteristics of SBISIS are given here. i) It has a strong
screening consistency property without finite sub-exponential
moments of the data even when the dimensionality is an exponential order of the
sample size since empirical SBI is a function of some indictors. ii) It is nonparametric
and has the property of robustness, which is also due to the boundedness of
the empirical SBI. iii) It works well for complex responses and/or predictors from
the definition of SBI. iv) It can extract important features even when the underlying
model is complicated.

Since the SBISIS picks out the important predictors based on their marginal
correlation, it may suffer from two possible issues. The first issue is that SBISIS
may miss some important predictors that are marginally uncorrelated, but jointly
correlated to the response. The second issue is that SBISIS may mistakenly select an
irrelevant variable that is highly correlated with some of the truly active predictors.
